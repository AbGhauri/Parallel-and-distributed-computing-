Performance Comparison:

- Sequential processing took 0.01 seconds.
- Parallel task achieved the following:
    * 2 workers: 0.000085s (Speedup: 117.65x)
    * 4 workers: 0.000150s (Speedup: 66.67x)
    * 8 workers: 0.000056s (Speedup: 178.57x)
- Best parallel speedup: 1.51x (with 8 workers).
- Distributed simulation across 2 nodes:
    * Node 1: 0.000003s (50.00%)
    * Node 2: 0.000003s (50.00%)
    * Total distributed simulation time: 0.02 seconds.

Analysis & Remaining Bottlenecks:
- Speedup values are not linear, mainly due to very low image processing timesâ€”overheads often dominate at this small dataset scale.
- Actual speedup benefits will be clearer with much larger datasets.
- On Colab and Google Drive I/O, file reading/writing and process startup can limit speed improvements when job size is tiny.
- For real-world (larger) tasks, parallel and distributed processing gives substantial gain over sequential workflows.
